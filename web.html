        The topic we have chosen is the MTA system in NYC, 
        focusing on its efficiency in being run, how well it meets users’
        expectations (comfort, delays, and safety) as well as ridership levels.
        Through this research, we hope to understand what causes passengers’
        satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the MTA service. This is a very 
        intriguing topic to cover because of the vast number of datasets that 
        are available in this sector/field. Given the MTA is public transportation,
        any surveys, tracking methods, and related information about the transportation 
        system are publicly accessible for analysis. To go into more detail about other 
        features that affect satisfaction, visit 
        <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3141/1735-16">this journal</a>.

        Going into more depth of satisfaction on the MTA, it is 
        also found that the more satisfied a customer is on the MTA, the more likely
        they are to stay loyal and continue using the MTA. This is what prompted us to 
        first start researching about this. If you'd like to learn more about why this is the 
        case, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40864-016-0042-0">this link</a>

        To delve deeper into our topic on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
        system in NYC, we chose a dataset that originated from the New York State open 
        database (data.ny.gov). Specifically, this dataset is sourced from the MTA open 
        data program/portal and contains 600,000+ rows/observations of MTA customer 
        feedback data submitted by MTA transit riders spanning from 2014 to 2019. Each 
        observation contains 8 columns: Agency, Commendation or Complaint, Subject Matter, 
        Subject Detail, Issue Detail, Year, Quarter, and lastly Branch/Line/Route.

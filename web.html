    <p class = "A" >The topic we have chosen is the MTA system in NYC, 
      focusing on its efficiency in being run, how well it meets users’ 
      expectations (comfort, delays, and safety) as well as ridership levels.
       Through this research, we hope to understand what causes passengers’ 
       satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the MTA service. This is a very 
       intriguing topic to cover because of the vast number of datasets that 
       are available in this sector/field. Given the MTA is public transportation,
        any surveys, tracking methods, and related information about the transportation 
        system are publicly accessible for analysis. <p>

        The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) system in New York City
        plays a critical role in the daily lives of millions of residents and
        visitors. As we look into one of the largest public transit systems in
        the world, we want to focus on its efficiency in being run, users' 
        experience/expectations (comfort, delays, and safety) as well as ridership
        levels. Through this research, we hope to understand what drives passengers’ 
        satisfaction or dissatisfaction and to identify the areas where the MTA can 
        improve to better serve its riders. The MTA's operations are intriguing to
        analyze because of the vast number of datasets available, including customer
        feedback, surveys, and performance metrics. Equipped with this data, we
        are able to delve into trends, understand patterns in complaints and commendations,
        and use this information to recommend improvements. To learn more about the 
        factors influencing public transportation satisfaction, visit

        We chose this topic because we believe that improving customer satisfaction with 
        the MTA can lead to significant benefits for both riders and the city as a whole. 
        Research shows that the more satisfied a customer is with a service, the more likely 
        they are to remain loyal and continue using it. By analyzing MTA complaints and 
        commendations, we can pinpoint the areas that most frustrate passengers and direct 
        our resources to solving those issues. Beyond individual satisfaction, a well-functioning 
        MTA system has broader implications for New York City. It reduces traffic congestion, 
        lowers carbon emissions, and ensures access to essential services for communities across 
        the city.If you'd like to understand more about the importance of customer loyalty in

    <h3 class="C">Introduction to our dataset</h3>

    <div class="data">
      <p class="A">
        To delve deeper into our topic on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
        system in NYC, we chose a dataset that originated from the New York State open 
        database (data.ny.gov). Specifically, this dataset is sourced from the MTA open 
        data program/portal and contains 600,000+ rows/observations of MTA customer 
        feedback data submitted by MTA transit riders spanning from 2014 to 2019. Each 
        observation contains 8 columns: Agency, Commendation or Complaint, Subject Matter, 
        Subject Detail, Issue Detail, Year, Quarter, and lastly Branch/Line/Route. The
        dataset provides a comprehensive overview of customer interactions with the MTA, 
        offering insights into complaints and commendations related to various aspects of 
        the transit system. These include service reliability, safety, and station cleanliness, 
        as well as broader categories like policies and schedules. While the dataset is 
        extensive, it contained several missing and unclear entries that required cleaning. 
        Specifically, Subject Detail had 2,180 missing values, Issue Detail had 55,389 missing 
        values, and Branch/Line/Route had 2,060 missing values, along with additional unclear 
        entries labeled as "No Value" and "Other." After cleaning the data, we were left with 
        193,762 usable entries and our dataset's integrity was enhanced to provide more actionable
        insights.

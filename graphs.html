        This graph compares the normalized complaint to 
        commendation ratio on NYC buses and subways, grouped 
        by the subject matter of the complaint. The general 
        trend is that the ratio of complaints to commendations 
        is higher for buses.

    <h3>Altair Plot</h3>
    <p class = "A" >This is a graph that shows the top 10 complaints 
        over the years and how they increased or decreased. You have the 
        option to choose between what complaint you want to see in detail 
        or you can choose to see all of the complaints over time. Some of the 
        complaints, such as crowding, are broken up into segments. This suggests 
        that crowding was a major problem for a couple of years, and then it was not, 
        but then it got back to being a huge problem.

    <h3 class = "C"> Top 10 Subway Routes and Their Top 4 Issues</h3>
    <p class = "A" >
        This visualization highlights the top 10 NYC subway routes and their most 
        common issues (complaint categories by frequency), excluding "Other." The 
        most reported problem, "Improper Function/Needs Repair/Damaged," points to 
        widespread maintenance challenges. Other frequent issues include "Not Working/Out 
        of Service" and "Litter/Garbage/Debris," reflecting operational inefficiencies 
        and cleanliness concerns. Complaint totals vary, with Route A having the most 
        (711) and Route Q the fewest (461). "No Announcement/Messages - Audio" also 
        appears on some routes, highlighting communication problems. These findings 
        emphasize the need to address maintenance, cleanliness, and communication, 
        particularly on heavily used routes and during peak hours.

    <h3 class = "C">Normalized Complaint to Commendation Ratio on NYC Buses vs Subways</h3>
    <p class = "A" >
        This grouped bar graph compares the normalized complaint to commendation
        ratio on NYC buses and subways, grouped by the subject matter of the
        complaint. The general trend is that the ratio of complaints to
        commendations is higher for buses than for subways. However, it can
        be seen that this is not the case for schedules and reservations, where
        the subways have a ratio that is approximately 0.05 greater than that of
        the buses. It can also be seen that the ratio of complaints to commendations
        towards employees is notably higher on buses than on subways, while in other
        categories they are somewhat similar. The one category where they are about
        equal is issues regarding customers, where both buses and trains have
        practically no commendations towards customers, only complaints.

    <h3 class = "C"> Proportional Employee Complaint Breakdown by Agency</h3>
    <p class = "A" >
        This stacked bar graph compares a breakdown of the proportions of the ten most
         popular complaint categories for each transport agency. It can be seen that
         in each agency, the largest complaint area is vehicle operators. On the
         subway and railroads, this is followed by the ticket clerks and station agents,
         after which comes the maintenance staff and customer service. On the buses,
         it's followed by dispatchers. Overall, it appears that the vast majority of
         complaints across all agencies go towards workers.

    <h3>Altair Plot</h3>
    <p class = "A" >This is a graph that shows the top 10 complaints 
        over the years and how they increased or decreased. You have the 
        option to choose between what complaint you want to see in detail 
        or you can choose to see all of the complaints over time. Some of the 
        complaints, such as crowding, are broken up into segments. This suggests 
        that crowding was a major problem for a couple of years, and then it was not, 
        but then it got back to being a huge problem. Other problems increased significantly 
        over the course of the years such as Improper function which suggests that the MTA 
        is severely downgrading as well.

  <h3 class = "C"> Seasonal Trends</h3>
    <p class = "A" >
    This bar graph uses d3 and shows the relationship between seasons and trends. It is interactive 
        in that the user has the ability to choose between commendations and complaints and see how either
        how the breakdown of their numbers by season. We can see from this chart that regarding complaints, 
        the summer and fall seasons are almost identical while the fall season has the most commendations overall. 
        Interestingly enough, the winter season appears to have the least complaints, but that can be related to 
        the complaints being primarily towards the workers and not the vehicles or modes of transport themselves.

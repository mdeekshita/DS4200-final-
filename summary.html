        Our analysis of customer feedback regarding the MTA has 
        revealed several insights into the operational issues and public 
        perceptions that impact New York’s transit systems. By examining the 
        nature of customer feedback by zooming in on certain aspects, we’ve identified 
        trends in the way passengers react to different types of issues.

        <p class="A">  
            One major insight we had seen was that there is a wide variety 
            of issues pertaining to the MTA and a high quantity of each issue too.
             This shows that in general the MTA system is not functioning as well 
             as it could and should be for a public transportation system. Based on the 
             first graph it seems that the major issue for most lines is the fact that 
             it is not functioning properly. This could be due to a lack of resources, 
             funding to replace broken parts, etc. 
            </a>.</p>

        <p class="A">  
                Another trend we noticed in our results aside from issues 
                with transit systems themselves was that the vast majority of 
                complaints made were directed towards workers. This is likely 
                the result of a wide range of underlying factors. For example,
                 something that may have influenced this is that people tend to 
                 see issues with other humans through a more emotional lens compared 
                 to issues with infrastructure, leading them to feel more incentivized 
                 to file a complaint. To look into this further in the future, we could 
                 look at the breakdown of reasons for complaints towards employees, and 
                 see how often behavioral or logistic issues appear.
                </a>.</p>
            
        <p class="A">  
                    For future improvements, we would like to make a map and plot where 
                    the most complaints are being logged. That way we can see if there 
                    is a specific area of the city that is drawing in the complaints, or 
                    if it is just spread out through the entire city. Another future visualization 
                    we could make would be to find data on age range and see if that changes the issues 
                    that are the most prominent. 
                </a>.</p>

        <p class="A">  
            This research is very important as the public transportation system 
            is a crucial part of the NYC lifestyle. Without it functioning properly,
             millions of people will not be able to get to work, school, get groceries, 
             and more. This is why it is important to make sure that the people using it 
             also have a good experience as it will motivate them to take it again later on.
